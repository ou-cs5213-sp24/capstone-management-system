All components of this project should be maintained under this repository and in subdirectories of this directory. Use `.gitignore` to manage files and folders that shouldn't be tracked.

## Milestone Tracking

The [Milestones page](https://github.com/ou-cs5213-sp24/capstone-management-system/milestones) can be used to track progress on the milestones in the development of the Capstone Management System.

## Issue and Task Tracking

The [Capstone Management System project](https://github.com/orgs/ou-cs5213-sp24/projects/1) is setup with 4 sprints. You may filter to you and/or your team's issues. Each team should work with their appointed scrum master to create issues which constitute the work required to complete the milestones which they have been assigned.

## Development Environment Setup

Team members with the developer role will need to set up a development environment.

* Install Python 3.9
* Create a virtual environment
* Install the dependencies for this project (will be available in `requirements.in` after Milestone 1)

# How to Contribute

The basic workflow for developers is the following:

* Clone the repo
* Create a branch based on `dev`
* Write a new feature or fix a bug
* Locally test your changes while you develop
* Push your branch to GitHub
* Open a pull/merge request on GitHub targeting `dev` and await a code review
* Upon a successful review, the branch will be merged into `dev`

For a more detailed description, please see [this tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). You don't have to use the GitFlow CLI tools, just understand the technique.

# Production Environment

To be filled out during the completion of Milestone 2.

* Where the production environment is located
* How to access the secrets for the production environment (secrets should be stored securely)
